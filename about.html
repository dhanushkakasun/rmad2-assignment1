            The Cargills philosophy has always been focused on community development and contributing towards a better
            Sri Lanka. This is why we say CSR is our business. From serving a few to serving the nation, Cargills has
            come a long way. By continuing to build markets for farming communities and creating opportunities for local
            entrepreneurs, Cargills has continued to invest in the community.
            This is because we believe in the future potential of Sri Lanka.
            <br>
            With a trusted heritage of over 175 years, the Cargills Group is built on the principles of reducing the
            cost of living, enhancing youth skills, and bridging regional disparities. Our commitment to developing a
            sustainable and socially responsible business has made us one of the leading consumer goods companies in the
            country. Spread across retail, food manufacturing, restaurants, and banking, Cargills touches the lives of
            millions of Sri Lankans every day, from customers to farmers to suppliers and the wider community
            Times have changed and Cargills as a company has evolved from strength to strength. Yet, one factor has
            remained constant: our top priority has always been ensuring the health and well-being of our consumers and
            customers through our commitment to the safety of our team.
            <br>
            We aim to maintain our Nation’s progress through our continued commitment to your health and well-being

            play in the day-to-day lives of our valuable customers. This is why we continue to train, and remind our
            teams to take care of their health so they safeguard you.
